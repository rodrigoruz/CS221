This is the 2nd course in the intermediate undergraduate-level offering in the larger Programming and Data Structures MicroBachelors program. We recommend taking them in order, unless you have a background in these areas already and feel comfortable skipping ahead.Introduction to Programming in C++Advanced Programming in C++Introduction to Data StructuresAdvanced Data StructuresThese topics build upon the learnings that are taught in the introductory-level Computer Science Fundamentals MicroBachelors program, offered by the same instructor.  This is a self-paced course that continues in the development of C++ programming skills. Among the topics covered is the development of more advanced command-line programs that utilize functions, arrays, and strings to solve problems. Students learn to program in C++ through the lectures and the labs. C++ programming material is presented over eight weeks of interactive lectures with bi-weekly quizzes to assess your understanding of the material Students will experience hands-on practice writing C++ programs through twelve lab challenges.Students will not only learn to use these more advanced procedural programming functionalities. They will also learn to analyze the computational complexity of their code. Computational complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by the mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying their computational complexity, i.e., the number of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. What you’ll learnApply basic searching and sorting algorithms in C++ programming.Apply single-and multi-dimensional arrays in C++ programming.Analyze a C++ function to determine itâs computational complexity. ",-,-,-,"    DetailsStudy Advanced Programming in C++ at New York University  Learn the advanced programming topics in the C++ programming language, including functions, computation complexity, arrays and strings.

Students receive an electronic certificate of completion at the end of the session.The diverse and inclusive communityÂ at YYGS enhances learning by inviting students to analyze issues from multiple perspectives. Living and learning alongside peers from around the world allows students to broaden their own world views by learning about countries and cultures they have never encountered before.Exploring Yale:Â typically, participants live on campus, explore surrounding areas and take advantage of opportunities that the Yale community offers.

In this program, you will learn the project management skills you need to successfully manage engineering projects. First you will focus on the early project phases, which are crucial to achieve project success. The areas covered include the project manager and the team, the project process and the project context. At the end of this part of the program you will have created your own project execution plan.But how will you deal with the inherent uncertainties linked to the length and scale of engineering and infrastructure projects and their constantly changing environments? As with most external factors, many of the causes and consequences of these uncertainties are difficult to avoid or control. Attempts to overcome these challenges by simply trying to reduce their causes is not enough.  In the second part of the program you will learn our approach to mastering project complexity, focused on front-end development and teamwork. You will develop the skills you need to make timely actions in order to tackle complexities and improve your chances of project success.You will learn to identify what makes a project complex and how to perform a complexity assessment. You will analyze these elements in the context of your own project.
